These are the codes for the following paper

Optimizing Resource Allocation in MEC-Enabled CR-NOMA-Assisted IoT Networks: A DRL-Driven Strategy; IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 2024; Qaiser, Sohail et.all (a copy of this paper is included as research/paper.pdf)


A good starting point is to run the file 'two_user_case.py', which is fast. In order to simulate the case with fading, the file 'special_case.py' should be used. The file 'random_location_with_fading K.py' will take quite long time to run.
